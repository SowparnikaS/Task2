# Automated Report Generation using Python
- This project is submitted as part of Task - 2 for the internship with CodTech. It demonstrates file handling, data analysis, and PDF report generation using Python.

## Objective
- Read and process structured data from a file (CSV)

- Analyze the data (summarization, grouping, statistics)

- Generate a clear and formatted PDF report

## Features
- Reads data from a CSV file

- Performs:

Record counting

Score summarization (average, highest)

Department-wise breakdown

Generates a professional PDF report using the fpdf library

Easy to customize and extend for different datasets

## Tech Stack
- Python

- CSV Module

- FPDF – PDF generation

- Collections (for data grouping)

## How to Run
- Make sure the following files are present:

generate_report.py

data.csv

- Install the required library:

pip install fpdf

Update the data.csv file with your dataset (or use sample provided)

- Run the script:

python generate_report.py

## Sample Output
- PDF report (report_sample.pdf) 

- Summary stats (total, average, highest)

- Department-wise score analysis

## Deliverables
- generate_report.py – Python script for report generation

- data.csv – Sample input data

- report_sample.pdf – Generated report

- README.md – Documentation file
